POS_HTBLA
=========

My repository for all our projects in the subject 'programming and software engineering'.
Sadly we only use C# and later Java in school, but I'm gonna try to use as many languages as possible.
I want to welcome each and every one of you to read through my code (even though it's not a lot and it's often very 'dirty' code)
and help me learning by providing meaningful feedback. So all kinds of constructive feedback are very appreciated.

Thank you,
Michael KÃ¶ppl
